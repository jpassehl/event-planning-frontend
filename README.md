# EventPlanningFrontend

I had an idea to create an app to help the "planner" of the friend group, as that's my role within my community of friends! ðŸ˜Š I love planning fun events and things to do with my friends, so I'm creating an app to help me to that! The goal is to keep track of "event ideas" (i.e. things we want to do together) , because what happens way too often is that we'll suggest something or we all express interest but it never actually happens! So we need a tool to track it! (think Jira/Trello but for friend hangouts ðŸ¤­). This is still very much a WIP, but I'm planning to continue to work on this whenever I have the time!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
